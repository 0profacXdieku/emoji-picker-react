# Anatel WN7600MV Wireless Drivers: How to Download and Install Them
 
If you have an Anatel WN7600MV wireless card in your computer and you need to update its drivers, you may have trouble finding them online. Anatel is a Brazilian certification agency for telecommunications products, not a manufacturer. The wireless card itself may have been made by another company, such as Lite-On or Mediatek. To find the right drivers for your wireless card, you need to identify its model name and chipset.

One way to do this is to open Device Manager on your Windows computer and look for the wireless card under Network adapters. You can also check the label on the card itself if you can access it. The model name should start with WN and the chipset should be a four-digit number starting with RT. For example, WN7600R-MV with RT2790 chipset.
 
Once you know the model name and chipset of your wireless card, you can search for the drivers online. You can try the following sources:
 
- The website of the manufacturer of your computer or wireless card. For example, if you have an HP computer with an Anatel wireless card, you can go to HP Support Community[^1^] and look for the driver there.
- The website of the chipset manufacturer. For example, if your wireless card uses a Mediatek chipset, you can go to Mediatek Downloads[^2^] and look for the driver there.
- A reputable driver download website. For example, you can go to DriverGuide[^3^] or OEM Drivers[^4^] and look for the driver there.

When you find the driver that matches your wireless card model and chipset, download it to your computer and unzip it if necessary. Then run the setup application or use Device Manager to install the driver. Follow the instructions on the screen and restart your computer if prompted.
 
After installing the driver, you should be able to connect to wireless networks with your Anatel WN7600MV wireless card. If you have any problems or questions, you can contact the support team of your computer or wireless card manufacturer, or post a thread on a tech support forum.

## How to Update Anatel WN7600MV Wireless Drivers Automatically
 
If you don't want to search and install the drivers for your Anatel WN7600MV wireless card manually, you can use a driver update utility to do it for you.

This can save you time and hassle, and ensure that your wireless card works properly.
 
There are many driver update utilities available online, but you should be careful when choosing one. Some of them may contain malware or unwanted programs, or charge you for their services.
