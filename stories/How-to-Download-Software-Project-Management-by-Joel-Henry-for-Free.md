What is Software Project Management?
 
Software project management is the process of planning, organizing, leading, and controlling software projects. It involves applying knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to achieve the project objectives within the constraints of scope, time, cost, quality, and risk. Software project management is a subset of software engineering, which is the discipline of applying engineering principles and practices to the development of software systems.
 
Why is Software Project Management Important?
 
Software project management is important because software projects are complex, dynamic, and uncertain. Software projects often involve multiple stakeholders, requirements, technologies, and deliverables that may change over time. Software projects also face various challenges and risks such as technical difficulties, human errors, communication issues, scope creep, budget overruns, schedule delays, quality defects, and customer dissatisfaction. Software project management helps to address these challenges and risks by providing a systematic and structured approach to plan, execute, monitor, and control software projects. Software project management also helps to ensure that the software products and services meet the expectations and needs of the customers and stakeholders.
